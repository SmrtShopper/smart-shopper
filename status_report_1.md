#Team 9: Status Report 1

##What Was Accomplished This Week
* Added AngularJS and Bootstrap functionality
* Added an editable list of groceries
* Implemented voice speech-to-text functionality using Google Speech Recognition 
API

##Challenges and Issues from This Week
* Figuring out where to implement AngularJS vs. Bootstrap and what the
differences between the two are; we now know AngularJS is for controllers, and
Bootstrap is for easier CSS stylesheet creation 
* We were unsure whether to make up our own test data or get real data using
the Nutritionix API; we are going to use the Nutritionix API to get lists of
food items based on search queries

##Goals for Next Week
* Get a working user interface with Nutritionix API embedded in the search
functionality
* Optimize the mobile interface
* Add ability to create your own food categories and add food to these 
categories
* Add pre-existing categories
* Check if browser supports the Google Speech to Text API, and if it doesn't,
do not display the record button
