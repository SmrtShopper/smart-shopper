Smart Shopper Design V2

2. Problem Statement: 
   - Grocery lists should be more than just todo lists. By making a dynamic grocery 
      list that is both mobile and desktop facing, it is possible to create a new user 
      experience where grocery lists aid in helping to make benificial nutritionally minded choices, or
      enable group sharing (an open grocery list, with a user link). No private information will be stored
      and no personally identifying information is linked to the user's grocery list. 

3. Solution: 
  - We are going to create a product which implements a 
      number of features to improve the efficiency and utility of grocery lists.  
      A more full-featured grocery list will make the experience of shopping regularly 
      much simpler and more enjoyable. Nutritional information that is dynamically 
      updated allows for users to be informed of their choices with ease. 

4. Features: 
  - Five Required Features
    - Server-side data persistence with MongoDB
    - Client-side data persistence: store user's shopping list so he/she can leave the webpage and come back to find the cart still there
    - Front-end framework including Bootstrap, AngularJS
    - Reporting grocery nutritional information
    - SMS with grocery list 
  - Extra Features
    - Mobile and web optimized sites
    - Voice recognition - using Google's Voice Recognition API
5. Data
  - Nutritionix API (for nutritional information)
  - TextBelt for SMS
  - Server at grocery-server.herokuapp.com
6. Algorithms
  - We sort and extract relevent nutritional data to show information in graphs
